# SugarizerOS
he Sugarizer OS project is a way to bring sugarizer as a full environment on a non-sugar device. In order to do so, Sugarizer OS will be an Android launcher replacing the native one. It will be fully compatible with the existing Android system and able to launch both native applications and Sugarizer activities.
