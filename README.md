# SugarizerOS
The Sugarizer OS project is a way to bring sugarizer as a full environment on a non-sugar device. In order to do so, Sugarizer OS will be an Android launcher replacing the native one. It will be fully compatible with the existing Android system and able to launch both native applications and Sugarizer activities.

## How to build SugarizerOS

(These steps are the build scheme described and used in the install.sh file. You can run ```sh install.sh``` to do them automatically)

First, create a new cordova package
```cordova create sugar-cordova```

Then, inside the created folder, remove the config.xml generated by cordova

```cd sugar-cordova; rm config.xml```

Remove the generated "www" folder to avoid conflicts when you'll clone sugarizer

```rm -r www```

Then, clone my fork of sugarizer in a new www directory

```git clone git@github.com:lupin012345/sugarizer.git www```

Finally, move the res/ directory and the config.xml file from www to the current directory

```mv www/res . ; cp www/config.xml .```


Now you can generate the android platform for our cordova project

```cordova platform add android```

And simply add the SugarizerOS plugin to build SugarizerOS instead of the regular Sugarizer

```cordova plugin add https://github.com/lupin012345/cordova-plugin-sugarizeros.git```

You can now simply deploy your cordova app on your device with

```cordova run```
